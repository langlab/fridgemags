## Fridgemags

Fridgemags allows you to create a screen/fridge of draggable magnets that update on all of the connected clients in real time.

This was a fun project I did as a proof of concept for some new skills and techniques I just learned, i.e.:

- It was my first Backbone.js app.
- I used nowjs to update the fridge state accross clients in real time.
- I used MongoDB to store the fridge state when no one is connected to it

There are some mistakes I made throughout this project that gave me a clearer picture of how I should use these technologies on another, larger project.
In fact, knowing what I know now, I should probably go back and refactor some of this code and clear up some of the 'antipattern' traps that I fell into.
A blog post on the whole process might not be such a bad idea, either! One of these days...
